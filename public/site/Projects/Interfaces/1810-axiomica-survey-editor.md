# Axiomica startup project: Design and coding of a survey editor MVP application.

I've participated in the development of the MVP application for the survey platform as designer and front-end developer (under the umbrella of our own Axiomica startup project).

I made the brand design (logotype, business cards), design of interface screens for some parts of application (Adobe XD), coded minimal interface prototype (using i-bem, bem-xjst, borschik stack and MUI) for survey editor (the main part of the system).

All confidential data has been removed due to a non-disclosure agreement.
