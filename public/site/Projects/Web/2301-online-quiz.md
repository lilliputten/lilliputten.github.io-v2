# Online multi-user text quiz game

Online multi-user text quiz game developed on Flask (Python) at server-side and NextJS (React, mobx) application for my Russian clients.

The game supports multi- and single-player modes. Potentially it can support more than two players.

Game Scenario: Players log in to the main screen and wait for a partner (the first available partner is randomly selected). After that, they go to the game screen itself, where they answer questions and can show their partner's progress.

The winner detecting by a formula that uses player's score and overall game time.

See [client](https://github.com/lilliputten/tournament-game-client) and [server](https://github.com/lilliputten/tournament-game-client) repositories, demo application will be available soon

The original site is in the possession of the client.
