# 360caster MVP web application

In the first half of the 20223, my partner and I made the MVP application for our last startup project 360caster.

The application is designed for conducting virtual 3D excursions and tours of premises and objects previously filmed with high quality, mainly for museums and exhibition spaces.

It allows guides and authors to use virtual reality, audio and video communication, and other means of communication, such as chat and FAQ pages. The most recently developed feature was the ability to make automatic tours (visitors will be guided by scenario script).
